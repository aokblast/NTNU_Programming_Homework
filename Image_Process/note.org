* CH0 - Introduction

** Objective:

+ Human Interpretation
  1. Image Sharpening
  2. Noise Removal
  3. Deblurring

+ Machine Perception
  1. Scene Understanding

** Three level processing:

1) Low-level Processing
   - Threshold
   - Noise Removal :: smoothing
   - Contrast Enhancement :: sharpening

2) Mid-level Processing
   - Grouping :: form region
   - Clustering :: associate with objects
   - Edge Detection
   - Image Segmentation :: locate primary area

3) High-levle Processing
   - Object Recognition
   - Scene Understanding

** Image Acquisition and Sampling

*** Eyes

[[./Eyes.png]]

+ Retina -> Image Plane
+ Fovea -> Principal Point
+ Lens -> Lens
+ Visual Axis -> Optical Axis

*** Digital Camera

+ CCD :: charge-coupled device
+ CMOS :: complementary metal oxide semiconductor

*** Sampling

+ Spatial Resolutino :: Pixel density
  Grid Effect
+ Grayscale Resolutino :: Quantization
  False Contours

** Image and Digital Image

+ Scene :: a 3-D continuous function
  \(g(x, y, z)\)
+ Image :: a 2-D continuous function
  \(f(x, y)\)
+ Digital Image :: a 2-D discrete function
  \(I(r, c)\)

Pixel: Picture element
Gray level: Pixel value (0-255)
Gray scale: Number of gray level

** Types of Digital Images

+ Grayscale Image :: One Channel (0-255)
+ Binary Image :: One Channel (0-1)
+ Color Image :: Three Channel (R, G, B)
+ Multispectral Image :: Multiple Channel
+ Radio Image
+ Ultrasound Iamge
+ Ultraviolet Image
+ X-ray Image
+ Gamma-ray Image
+ CT Image
+ Range Image :: The Gray level is distance
+ Moire Image :: High interfere Image (Phone photo) (?)
+ Structure light Image :: Projectile Image

** Image Perception

+ Simultaneous contrast
+ Optical illusion
+ Subjective Object
+ Obershoot and Undershoot (?)

* CH2 - File Format

+ BMP :: Without Compression
+ JPEG :: Lossy compression, smaller storage
+ GIF :: Lossless compression
+ TIFF :: Multiple image
+ PNG :: Lossless compression

** Gamma Correction

* CH3 - Image Display

** Quality

+ Spatial Resolution
+ Quantization

** Display device

+ Monitor Type
+ Monitor Resolution
+ Graphic card
+ Printer

** Working environment

** Ditchering

The process of reduce the number of gray level in an image using similar dots

1. Uniform Quantization :: 0.5 -> False contours
2. Random Noise :: 0.5 + noise
3. Order ditching :: Using matrix to decide 0 or 1
4. Error Diffusion :: Use matrix to represent  error

** Half toning

Using different size and distnace to represent multiple gray levels by two color

** Point Proessing

** Point processing

+ Addition and Subtraction
  y = x + C, y = x - C

+ Multiplication
  y = Cx

+ Complementation
  y = 255 - x

+ Solarization
  y = 255 - x if x < 128
  y = x if x >= 128

+ Histogram Equalization
  - Continous
  \[  ps(s) = pr(r)|dr / ds| \]

  - Discrete
    L = number of gray level
  \[  Sk = (L - 1)\Sigma^k_0 n_j / N \]

+ Contrast stretching
  General form:
  \[ y = ((x - a) / (b - a)) ^ r (d - c) + c \]
  r effect shape of curve

** Neighborhood processing

+ Different size
+ Different shape
+ Different reference point

** Mask + Function = Filter

+ Image Boundary
  1. Ignore it
  2. Pad with Zero
  3. Copy

+ Value outside 0-255
  1. Clip value
  2. Scale value

*** Linear filter

\[ \Sigma_{s = -1}^{1} \Sigma_{t = -2}^{2} p(x + s, y + t) m(s, t) \]

*** Seperable filter

\[ f(x, y) = (f_1(x) f_2(y) \]


*** Frequency domain filter

+ High frequency components
  edges, noises
+ Low frequency components
  regions

*** Edge sharpening

[[./Edge_Sharpening.png]]

*** High-boost filter

+ k(original) - (lowpass) = k(original) - (original - highpass) = (k - 1)(original) + highpass
+ (k/(k-1))(original) + (1/(k-1))(low pass)
+ (k/(2k-1))(original) + ((1-k)/(2k-1))(low pass)

*** Non-linear smoothing filters

+ Maximum filter
+ Minimum filter
+ Median filter
  Noise removal
  edge preserving
+ Kuwahara filter
+ K-nearth neighbors
+ Geometry mean filter
+ Alpha-trimmed mean filter
  1. Order elements
  2. Trim off m end elements
  3. Take mean

* Image Geometry

Consider transformation of the:

+ Shape
+ Size
+ Position
+ Orientation

Two types:

+ Rigid transformation
  Transformation directly, with edge
+ Deformable transformation
  Transformation without edge

** Transformation method

*** Sampling

[[./Sampling.png]]

*** Interpolation

[[./Interpolation.png]]

+ NN-Interpolation
+ Linear-Interpolation

*** Cubic Interpolation

[[./Cubic_Interpolation.png]]

*** Bicubic interpolation

Apply cubic interpolation first along the rows and then down the columns

** Image Enlargement

1. Zero interleave
2. Filling or bilinear interpolation, bicublic interpolation
   +  NN
     [[./nn.png]]
   + Bilinear
     [[./bi.png]]
   + Bicubic
     [[./bic.png]]

** Image Reduction

** Image Rotation

Solution:
+ Enlarge image size
+ Inverse transformation
