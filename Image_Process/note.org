* CH0 - Introduction

** Objective:

+ Human Interpretation
  1. Image Sharpening
  2. Noise Removal
  3. Deblurring

+ Machine Perception
  1. Scene Understanding

** Three level processing:

1) Low-level Processing
   - Threshold
   - Noise Removal :: smoothing
   - Contrast Enhancement :: sharpening

2) Mid-level Processing
   - Grouping :: form region
   - Clustering :: associate with objects
   - Edge Detection
   - Image Segmentation :: locate primary area

3) High-levle Processing
   - Object Recognition
   - Scene Understanding

** Image Acquisition and Sampling

*** Eyes

[[./Eyes.png]]

+ Retina -> Image Plane
+ Fovea -> Principal Point
+ Lens -> Lens
+ Visual Axis -> Optical Axis

*** Digital Camera

+ CCD :: charge-coupled device
+ CMOS :: complementary metal oxide semiconductor

*** Sampling

+ Spatial Resolutino :: Pixel density
  Grid Effect
+ Grayscale Resolutino :: Quantization
  False Contours

** Image and Digital Image

+ Scene :: a 3-D continuous function
  \(g(x, y, z)\)
+ Image :: a 2-D continuous function
  \(f(x, y)\)
+ Digital Image :: a 2-D discrete function
  \(I(r, c)\)

Pixel: Picture element
Gray level: Pixel value (0-255)
Gray scale: Number of gray level

** Types of Digital Images

+ Grayscale Image :: One Channel (0-255)
+ Binary Image :: One Channel (0-1)
+ Color Image :: Three Channel (R, G, B)
+ Multispectral Image :: Multiple Channel
+ Radio Image
+ Ultrasound Iamge
+ Ultraviolet Image
+ X-ray Image
+ Gamma-ray Image
+ CT Image
+ Range Image :: The Gray level is distance
+ Moire Image :: High interfere Image (Phone photo) (?)
+ Structure light Image :: Projectile Image

** Image Perception

+ Simultaneous contrast
+ Optical illusion
+ Subjective Object
+ Obershoot and Undershoot (?)

* CH - 2 File Format

+ BMP :: Without Compression
+ JPEG :: Lossy compression, smaller storage
+ GIF :: Lossless compression
+ TIFF :: Multiple image
+ PNG :: Lossless compression
