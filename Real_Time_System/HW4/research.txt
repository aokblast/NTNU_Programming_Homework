In our experiment result, we can discover that our background scheduling method outperforms our Deferrable Server method.
I think the reason is that our deferrable server implementation has many locks and thus the tradeoff is big. 
The deferrable server thread will prevent other thread from executing because it has the hightest priority.
What's more, the aperiodic tasks are generated by CTRL-C that is control by our hand. But the muscle of our hand cannot be as fast as the computer time clock. 
So the frequecy of our aperiodic task is not in the same magnitude of computer clock. So the advantage of deferrable server on aperiodic task will not perform as the ideal case.
