According to the definition of Rate-Monotonic, the higher frequency (shorter period) a process has, the higher priority it has.
And in the manual of chrt. There is a use menthod like chrt -f [priority] [pogram] [argument].
The following commands:
chrt -f 99 ./p1 &
chrt -f 98 ./p2 &
Set p1 (higher frequency) with 99 (higher priority) and Set p2 (lower frequency) with 98 (lower priority) will comply with the definition of rate-monotonic and thus can implement this scheduling policy.
By the way, both of them are set into FIFO scheduler. Which will interrupt the normal process and use the real time scheduler in the Linux.
