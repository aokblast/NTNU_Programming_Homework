Experiment setup:
CPU: i7-9700K
RAM: 64GB DDR4 2400MHz
OS: Arch Linux Kernel Version 6.1.3

Observasion:
1. How I decide the periods and the execution time of middle task?
Without any middle task, I found the CPU usage is 30%. So I create a task that runs 10000000 times with period 1s. I found the CPU usage is almost 50% this time. I duplicate this task as two and the CPU usage is 70%.
Then I reduce the period to 500ms which is half of the original 1s. The CPU usage is 85~87% now. Finally, I change the time period to 400ms, and the CPU usage is 94~96% right now.
2. How many middle-priority tasks were there and why?
As describe above, I use 2 same tasks. And these two tasks' priority is 95. I think we should not use too many tasks because the cost of context switch and timer will make the experiment not that precise and hard to predict.
