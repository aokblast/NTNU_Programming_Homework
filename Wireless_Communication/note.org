** Information, Data, and Signal

- Data
  A representation of facts, concepts or instructions in a formal representation
- Information
  Means of data
- Signal
  + Digital Signal: discrete
    Cheaper
    Suffer more attenuation
    Less susceptible to noise inteference
    Repeater recover the signal
    Retransmission device generate new and clean analog signal

  + Analog Signal: continuous

* CH3

** Classification of Transmission Media

*** Transmission Medium

Physical path between transmitter and receiver

+ Guided Media
  solid Medium
  E.g. copper twisted pair, copper coaxial cable, optical fiber

+ Unguided Media
  Provide means of transmission but oes not guide signals
  Wireless transmission
  Transmitter and receiver are antenna
  E.g. atmosphere, outer space

*** Configuration for wireless transmission

- Omnidirectional
- Directional

*** General frequency ranges

+ Radio
  30MHz to 1GHz
  Omnidirectional applications

+ Infrared
  Roughly, 300 GHz to 200000 GHz
  P2P multiopoint applications

+ Microwave
  1GHz to 300 GHz
  Directional beams possible
  P2P transmission
  Staellite, WiFi, ...etc

*** Terrestrial Microwave

+ Common microwave antenna
  Parabolic dish, 3m in diameter
  Fixed rigidly and focuses a narrow beam
  Achieve line-of-sight transmission to receiving antenna
  Substantial heights above ground level

+ Application
  Long haul telecommunication service
  Short P2P links between buildings

*** Satellite Microwave

+ Communication satellite
  Microwave relay station
  Link two or more ground-based microwave transmitter/receiver
  Receive transmissions on one frequency band(uplink)
  Amplifies or repeat the signal
  Transmit it on another frequency(downlink)

+ Application
  Television distribution
  Long-distance telephone transmission
  Private business networks

*** Wireless LAN microwave

+ Wireless LAN
  2.4G industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands
  Using wireless distribution method (spread-spectrum or OFDM radio)

+ Applications (802.11)
  WiFi

*** Broadcast Radio

+ Broadcast radio antennas
  Omnidirectional
  Not need to be dish-shaped
  Not need to be rigidly mounted

+ Application
  Broadcast radio
  VHF and part of UHF band; 30 MHz to 1GHz
  Cover FM radio and UHF and VHF television

** Multiplexing

+ Capacity of transmission medium usually exceed capacity required fpr transmission for a single signal
+ Multiplexing - carrying multile signals on a single medium

*** Why Multiplexing is widespread

+ Cost per kbps of transmission facility declines -> increase in the data rate
+ Cost of transmission and receiving equipmemt decline -> increase in the data rate
+ Most individual data communicating device require relatively modest data rate support

*** Multiplexing Techniques

+ FDM
  Use different frequency to carry multiple data
  Take advantage of the fact that the useful bandwidth of the medium exceed the required bandwidth of a given signal
+ TDM
  Take advantage of the fact that the achievable bit rate of the medium exceed the required data rate of a digital signal

* CH5

An antenna is an electrical conductor or system of conductors
The same antenna can be used for transmission and reception

+ Transmission :: radiate electromagnetic energy into space
+ Reception :: collects electromagnetic energy from space

** Radiation Pattern

+ Radiation pattern
  Graphical representation of radiation properties of an antenna
  Depicted as two-dimensional cross section

+ Beam width ( or half-power beam width )
  Measure of directivity of antenna
  Angele must at least 1/2 fo antenna's strongest direction

+ Reception pattern
  Equals to radiation pattern

** Type of Antenna

+ Isotropic antenna (dealize)
  Radiates power equally in all directions

+ Dipole antennas
  Half-wave dipole antenna ( Hertz antenna )
  Quarter-wave vertical antenna ( Marconi antenna )

+ Parabolic Reflective Antenna

** Antenna Gain

*** Antenna gain

+ Power output in a particular direction, compared to that produced by perfect isotropic antenna
+ Howe well the antenna converts input power into radio waves headed in a specified direction

\[ G = \frac{4 \pi A_e}{\lambda ^2 } \]


*** Effective area

+ Related to physical size and shape of antenna

[[./antenna_gains.png]]

** Propagation Modes

+ Ground-wave propagation
  Follow contour of the earth
  Can propagate considerable distances
  Frequency up to 2 MHz
  E.g. AM radio

+ Sky-wave propagation
  Signal reflected from ionized layer of atmosphere back down to earch
  Can travel a number of hops, back and forth between ionosphere and earth's surface
  Reflection effect caused by refraction
  E.g. Amateur radio, CB radio

+ Line-of-sight propagation
  Transmitting and receiving antennas must be witin line of sight
  Satellite communication - signal above 30MHz not reflected by ionosphere
  Ground communication - antennas within effective line of site due to refraction

*** Refraction :: bending of microwaves by the atmosphere

Velocity of electromagnetic wave is a function of the density of the medium
When wave changes medium, speed changes
Wave bends at the boundary between mediums

*** Line-of-Sight Equations

+ Optical line of sight

\[  d = 3.57\sqrt{h} \]

+ Effective, or radio, line of sight

\[  d = 3.57\sqrt{Kh} \]

\[ K = \frac{4}{3} \]

+ Maximum distance d between two antennas for LOS propagation

\[ d = 3.57(\sqrt{Kh_1} + \sqrt{Kh_2}) \]


** LOS wireless transmission impairment

*** Attenuation

+ Strength of signal falls of with distance over transmission medium
+ Attenuation factors for unguided media
  Received signal must have sufficient strength so that circuitry in the receiver can interpret the signal
  Signal must maintain a level sufficiently higher than noise to be received without errore
  Attenuation is greater at higher frequency, causing distortion

** Free space Loss

*** Ideal isotropic antenna

\[ \frac{P_t}{P_r} = \frac{(4 \pi d)^2}{\lambda ^ 2} = \frac{(4\pi fd)^2}{c^2}\]

\[ L_{dB} = 10 \log \frac{P_t}{P_r} = 20 log (\frac{4 \pi d }{\lambda}) = -20log(\lambda) + 20 log (d) + 21.98 dB \]
\[ = 20 log (\frac{4 \pi fd}{c}) = 20 log (f) + 20 log (d) - 147.56 dB \]

*** Accounting for gain of other antennas

\[ \frac{P_t}{P_r} = \frac{(4 \pi ) ^2 (d) ^2}{G_rG_t\lambda ^ 2} = \frac{(\pi d) ^ 2}{A_rA_t} = \frac{(cd) ^ 2}{f^2A_rA_t}  \]

\[ L_{dB} = 10 log (\frac{P_t}{P_r}) = 20 log (\lambda) + 20 log (d) - 10 log (A_tA_r) = -20 log (f) + 20 log (d) - 10 log(A_tA_r) + 169.54dB \]

* CH4

** Categories of Noise

+ Thermal Noise
  Due to agitation of electrons
  Present in all electronic devices and transmission media
  Cannot be eliminated
  Function of temperature
  Particularly significant for satellite communication
  \[ N_0 = kT(\frac{W}{Hz}) where k = 1.3803 * 10 ^{-23} (J/K) \]
  \[ N = N_0B = 10 log (kTB) = 10 log k + 10 log B + 10 log T = -228.6 + 10 log T + 10 log B \]

+ Intermodulation Noise
  Resulted from signals at different frequencies share same transmission medium
  Produeces signals at a frequency that is sum or difference of the two original or multiplies of those frequencies

+ Crosstalk
  An unwanted coupling between signal paths - telephone - able to hear another conversation
  Signal picked up by microwave antenna
  Directional antennas still have crosstalk problem
  Same r less order of magnitude as thermal noise

+ Impulse Noise
  Noncontinuous
  Consisting of irregular pulse or nise spike of short duration and high amplitide
  External electromagnetic disturbance
  Minor annoyance for analog data
  Primary source of error in digital data transmission

** Expression Eb/N0

Ratio of signal energy (E_b) per bit to noise power density (N_0) per Hertz

\[ \frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{S}{N_0R}  \]
\[ E_b = signal energy per bits = ST_b \]
\[ S = signal power \]
\[ T_b = time required to send one bit \]
\[ R = bit rate of a signal contains binary digital data = \fraC{1}{T_b} \]

The bit error rate for digital data is a function of E_b/N_0

\[ (\frac{E_b}{N_0})_{dB} = (\frac{S}{kTR})_dB = S_{dBW} = 10 log R - 10 log k - 10 log T = S_{dBW} - 10 log R + 228.6 - 10 log T  \]

According to Shannon Capacityt Formula \[ C = B log_2(1 + \frac{S}{N}) \]

\[ \frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{S}{N}\frac{B_T}{R} = \frac{B}{C}(2^{\frac{C}{B}} - 1 ) \]

*** Other Impairment

+ Atmospheric absorption
  Water vapor and oxygen contribute to attenuation

+ Multipath
  Obstacle reflect signals so that multiple copies with varying delays are received
  - Reflaction
  - Diffraction
  - Scattering

+ Refraction
  Bending of radio waves as they propagate through the atmosphere

*** Effect of Multipath Propagation

+ Multiple copies of a signal may arrive at different phases
+ Intersymbol interference - Multiple copies of a signal may arrive as the primary pulse for subsequent bit

** Type of Fading

+ Fast fading
  Rapidly changing fading
  E.g. mobile phone user passes buildins, tunnels, etc.

+ Slow fading
  Change in average received power level of rapid fluctuations

+ Flat fading
  All frequency components of the received signal fluctuate in the same proportion

+ Selective fading
  Affects unequally the different spectral components

+ Rayleigh fading
  multiple indirect paths and no distinct dominant path (i.e. LOS path)

+ Rician fading
  multiple indirect paths and a distinct dominant path (i.e. LOS path)

** Error Compensation Mechanisms

+ Forward erorr correction
+ Adaptive equalization
  Can be applied to transmissions that carry analog or digital information
  - Analog voice or video
  - Digital data, digitized voice or video

  Used to combat intersymbol interference
  Involves gathering dispersed symbol energy back into its original time interval
  Techniques
  - Lumped analog circuits
  - Sophisticated digital signal processing algorithm

+ Diversity techniques
  Diversity is based on the fact that individual channel experience independent fading events
  - Space diversity
  - Frequency diversity
  - Time diversity

* CH 5

** Signal Encoding Criteria

+ SNR
  Decrease bit eror rate
+ Data rate
  Increase bit error rate
+ Bandwidth
  Increate data rate

*** Factors

+ Signal spectrum
  With lack of high-frequency component, less bandwidth required ( Shannon Nyquist's Theorm )
  With no dc component, ac coupling via transformer possible
  Transfer fucntion of a channel is worse near band edge

+ Clocking
  Ease of determining beginning and end of each bit position

+ Signal interference and noise immunity
  Perform in the presence of noise

+ Cost and complexity
  Higher signal reate to achieve a given data rate, the greater the cost

*** Basic encoding technique

Digital to analog signal

+ Amplitude-shift keying (ASK)
  Amplitude difference of carrier frequency
  One binary digit represented by presence of carrier, at condsant amplitute
  Other represneted by absence of carrier
  Susceptible to sudden changes
  Inefficient modulation technique
  On voice-grade lines, up to 1200 bps
  Used to transmit digital data over optical fiber
  

+ Frequency-shift keying (FSK)
  Frequency difference near carrier frequency
  - Binary Frequency-Shift Key (BFSK)
     Less susceptible to error than ASK
     On voice-grade line, used up to 1200 bps
     Use for high-frequency radio transmission (3 to 30 MHz)
     Can be used at higher freqencies on LANS that use coaxial cable

  - Multiple Frequency-Shift Key (MFSK)
     Use more than two frequencies
     More bandwidth efficient but more susceptible
       \[ s(t) = A\cose 2 \pi f_it 1 \leq i \leq M \]
       \[ f_i = f_c + (2i - 1 - M)f_d \]
       \[ f_c = \text{the carrier frequency} \]
     To match data rate of input bit stream, each output signal element is held for
     \[ T_s = LT \]
     Total bandwidth required:
     \[ 2Mf_d \]
     Minimum frequency separation reqired
     \[ 2f_d = \frac{1}{T_s} \]
     Therefore, modulation requres a bandwidth of
     \[ W_d = \frac{2^L}{LT} = \frac{M}{T_s} \]

+ Phase-shift keying (PSK)
  Phase of carrier signal shifted
  - Two-level PSK (BPSK)
  - Differential PSK (DPSK)
     signal burst of same phase as previous signal burst
  - Four-level PSK (QPSK)
     Allow symbol phase to jump by as much as 180 degree at a time
  - OQPSK
     Offset the timing of 1 bit-period T_b which limit the phase shift to no more than 90 degree at a time
