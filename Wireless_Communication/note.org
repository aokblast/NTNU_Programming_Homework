* CH2

** Ad hoc wireless network :: infrastructure less

- Peer to peer

- Dynamic topology

** Sensor Network :: energy driven

- Nodes powered by non-rechargable battery
- Data flow to a certain sink
- Low per-node rate, but up to 10000 nodes
- Data hightly correlate in time and space

*** Energy constrain node

- Maximize bit transmission time to minimize energy consumption
- Introduce delay versus energy tradeoff for each bit
- Old technique may not necessarily energy-efficient
- Sleep mode saves energy but complicate network


** Distributed control network :: hard delay and reliability requirement (traffic light?)

- Packet loss and delay impacts controller performance
- Control design must be robust to network fault
- Joint communication network and application design

*** Joint design

** Information, Data, and Signal

- Data
  A representation of facts, concepts or instructions in a formal representation
- Information
  Means of data
- Signal
  + Digital Signal: discrete
    Cheaper
    Suffer more attenuation
    Less susceptible to noise inteference
    Repeater recover the signal
    Retransmission device generate new and clean analog signal

  + Analog Signal: continuous
    Wireless
    Fiber
    Cable
    Transmit with out regard to content
    Amplifier boost signal but cause distortion

** Frequency-Domain Concept

- Fundamental frequency
  Gcd of all frequency
- Spectrum
  Range of the frequency signal
- Absolute bandwidth
  Width of the spectrum
- Effective bandwidth
  Narrow of the bandwidth that most of the signal's energy is contained in

Period of the total signal equals to the period of the fundamental frequency

** Data rate and bandwidth


** Channel Capacity

Maximum bits rate for transmission

*** Nyquist formula

\[ 2Blog_{2}M \]

*** SNR

measured at a receiver

\[ SNR_{db} = 10log_{10}S/N \]

*** Shannon Capacity formula

\[ C = Blog_2(1 + S/N) \]

Only consider white noise

* CH3

** Classification of Transmission Media

*** Transmission Medium

Physical path between transmitter and receiver

+ Guided Media
  solid Medium
  E.g. copper twisted pair, copper coaxial cable, optical fiber

+ Unguided Media
  Provide means of transmission but oes not guide signals
  Wireless transmission
  Transmitter and receiver are antenna
  E.g. atmosphere, outer space

*** Configuration for wireless transmission

- Omnidirectional
- Directional

*** General frequency ranges

+ Radio
  30MHz to 1GHz
  Omnidirectional applications

+ Infrared
  Roughly, 300 GHz to 200000 GHz
  P2P multiopoint applications

+ Microwave
  1GHz to 300 GHz
  Directional beams possible
  P2P transmission
  Staellite, WiFi, ...etc

*** Terrestrial Microwave

+ Common microwave antenna
  Parabolic dish, 3m in diameter
  Fixed rigidly and focuses a narrow beam
  Achieve line-of-sight transmission to receiving antenna
  Substantial heights above ground level

+ Application
  Long haul telecommunication service
  Short P2P links between buildings

*** Satellite Microwave

+ Communication satellite
  Microwave relay station
  Link two or more ground-based microwave transmitter/receiver
  Receive transmissions on one frequency band(uplink)
  Amplifies or repeat the signal
  Transmit it on another frequency(downlink)

+ Application
  Television distribution
  Long-distance telephone transmission
  Private business networks

*** Wireless LAN microwave

+ Wireless LAN
  2.4G industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands
  Using wireless distribution method (spread-spectrum or OFDM radio)

+ Applications (802.11)
  WiFi

*** Broadcast Radio

+ Broadcast radio antennas
  Omnidirectional
  Not need to be dish-shaped
  Not need to be rigidly mounted

+ Application
  Broadcast radio
  VHF and part of UHF band; 30 MHz to 1GHz
  Cover FM radio and UHF and VHF television

** Multiplexing

+ Capacity of transmission medium usually exceed capacity required fpr transmission for a single signal
+ Multiplexing - carrying multile signals on a single medium

*** Why Multiplexing is widespread

+ Cost per kbps of transmission facility declines -> increase in the data rate
+ Cost of transmission and receiving equipmemt decline -> increase in the data rate
+ Most individual data communicating device require relatively modest data rate support

*** Multiplexing Techniques

+ FDM
  Use different frequency to carry multiple data
  Take advantage of the fact that the useful bandwidth of the medium exceed the required bandwidth of a given signal
+ TDM
  Take advantage of the fact that the achievable bit rate of the medium exceed the required data rate of a digital signal

* CH5

An antenna is an electrical conductor or system of conductors
The same antenna can be used for transmission and reception

+ Transmission :: radiate electromagnetic energy into space
+ Reception :: collects electromagnetic energy from space

** Radiation Pattern

+ Radiation pattern
  Graphical representation of radiation properties of an antenna
  Depicted as two-dimensional cross section

+ Beam width ( or half-power beam width )
  Measure of directivity of antenna
  Angele must at least 1/2 fo antenna's strongest direction

+ Reception pattern
  Equals to radiation pattern

** Type of Antenna

+ Isotropic antenna (dealize)
  Radiates power equally in all directions

+ Dipole antennas
  Half-wave dipole antenna ( Hertz antenna )
  Quarter-wave vertical antenna ( Marconi antenna )

+ Parabolic Reflective Antenna

** Antenna Gain

*** Antenna gain

+ Power output in a particular direction, compared to that produced by perfect isotropic antenna
+ Howe well the antenna converts input power into radio waves headed in a specified direction

\[ G = \frac{4 \pi A_e}{\lambda ^2 } \]


*** Effective area

+ Related to physical size and shape of antenna

[[./antenna_gains.png]]

** Propagation Modes

+ Ground-wave propagation
  Follow contour of the earth
  Can propagate considerable distances
  Frequency up to 2 MHz
  E.g. AM radio

+ Sky-wave propagation
  Signal reflected from ionized layer of atmosphere back down to earch
  Can travel a number of hops, back and forth between ionosphere and earth's surface
  Reflection effect caused by refraction
  E.g. Amateur radio, CB radio

+ Line-of-sight propagation
  Transmitting and receiving antennas must be witin line of sight
  Satellite communication - signal above 30MHz not reflected by ionosphere
  Ground communication - antennas within effective line of site due to refraction

*** Refraction :: bending of microwaves by the atmosphere

Velocity of electromagnetic wave is a function of the density of the medium
When wave changes medium, speed changes
Wave bends at the boundary between mediums

*** Line-of-Sight Equations

+ Optical line of sight

\[  d = 3.57\sqrt{h} \]

+ Effective, or radio, line of sight

\[  d = 3.57\sqrt{Kh} \]

\[ K = \frac{4}{3} \]

+ Maximum distance d between two antennas for LOS propagation

\[ d = 3.57(\sqrt{Kh_1} + \sqrt{Kh_2}) \]


** LOS wireless transmission impairment

*** Attenuation

+ Strength of signal falls of with distance over transmission medium
+ Attenuation factors for unguided media
  Received signal must have sufficient strength so that circuitry in the receiver can interpret the signal
  Signal must maintain a level sufficiently higher than noise to be received without errore
  Attenuation is greater at higher frequency, causing distortion

** Free space Loss

*** Ideal isotropic antenna

\[ \frac{P_t}{P_r} = \frac{(4 \pi d)^2}{\lambda ^ 2} = \frac{(4\pi fd)^2}{c^2}\]

\[ L_{dB} = 10 \log \frac{P_t}{P_r} = 20 log (\frac{4 \pi d }{\lambda}) = -20log(\lambda) + 20 log (d) + 21.98 dB \]
\[ = 20 log (\frac{4 \pi fd}{c}) = 20 log (f) + 20 log (d) - 147.56 dB \]

*** Accounting for gain of other antennas

\[ \frac{P_t}{P_r} = \frac{(4 \pi ) ^2 (d) ^2}{G_rG_t\lambda ^ 2} = \frac{(\pi d) ^ 2}{A_rA_t} = \frac{(cd) ^ 2}{f^2A_rA_t}  \]

\[ L_{dB} = 10 log (\frac{P_t}{P_r}) = 20 log (\lambda) + 20 log (d) - 10 log (A_tA_r) = -20 log (f) + 20 log (d) - 10 log(A_tA_r) + 169.54dB \]
