#+TITLE: Wireless Communication

* CH1 - Intro

** Celluar System

- Shrinking cell size increase capacity.
- Coverage from large to small
  + Macrocell ~ 35 km
  + Microcell ~ 2 km
  + Picocell ~ 200 m
  + Femtocell ~ 10 m
- Generation
  + 1G: pure voice (analog)
  + 2G: voice + sms (digital)
  + 2.5G: voice + mms + data
  + 3G: voice + mms + data
    384 Kbps
    Burst data
    CDMA
    Packet-base switching
  + 4G: data + video
    50 ~ 100 Mbps
  + 5G: Mission critical App

** Satellite System

- Cover large region
- GEO(39000km)
  1 way transmission: TV and radio
- LEO(2000km)
  2 way transmission: satellite communication
- GPS

** Paging System

- Broad coverage for short message
- Message broad from all base station
- Simple terminal
- 1 way transmission
- By cellular

** Radio broadcast

- Analog: AM, FM, and analog TV
- Digital: DAB / DAV system
  OFDM
  HiFi/HiTV
  DVB-H
- 1 way service

** Cordless phone

- 1st generation: analog, poor quality
- 2nd generation: digital
  CT - 2
  DECT

** PHS

- Metropolitan wide communication tool

** Wifi

- Shared channel access

*** 802.11b

- 2.4G
- CDMA
- 1.6 ~ 10 Mbps, 500 ft

*** 802.11a

- 5G
- OFDM
- 54Mbps

*** 802.11g

- 2.4G, competible with 11b
- OFDM
- 54Mbps

*** 802.11n

- Support MIMO
- 150Mbps
- Support two HDTV streams

*** 802.11ac

- Support Multi-user MIMO
- video channels

** Bluetooth

- RF technology
- Short range (10m)
- 2.4G band
- 1 data channel and three voice channel

** Ultra-Wideband Radio

- impulse radio
- no need carrier
- use a lot of bandwidth
- low probability of detection
- ranging capability
- unique position property
- low power cmos transmission
- very high data rate possible ( 500 Mbps ~ 10ft )

** Zigbee

- Low rate WPAN
- 20, 40, and 250 kbps
- Star cluster or peer to peer operation
- Support for low latency
- CDMA-CA
- very low power consumption
- ISM band


* CH2

** Ad hoc wireless network :: infrastructure less

- Peer to peer
- No backbone
- Router can be multi-hop
- Dynamic topology

** Sensor Network :: energy driven

- Nodes powered by non-rechargable battery
- Data flow to a certain sink
- Low per-node rate, but up to 10000 nodes
- Data hightly correlate in time and space

*** Energy constrain node

- Maximize bit transmission time to minimize energy consumption
- Introduce delay versus energy tradeoff for each bit
- Old technique may not necessarily energy-efficient
- Sleep mode saves energy but complicate network


** Distributed control network :: hard delay and reliability requirement (traffic light?)

- Packet loss and delay impacts controller performance
- Control design must be robust to network fault
- Joint communication network and application design

*** Joint design

- No methology incooperate random delay or packet loss into control system design
- The best rate/delay tradeoff for a system cannot be determined

** Cognitive radios :: new paradise of spectrum use

- Second generation for Software Radio
- Dynamic spectrum usage
- Programmable platform

** Next-generation broadband :: IEEE-802.20
** Nano Wireless system :: medical purpose
** RFID-based systems :: bar code replacemnet

** Information, Data, and Signal

- Data
  A representation of facts, concepts or instructions in a formal representation
- Information
  Means of data
- Signal
  + Digital Signal: discrete
    Cheaper
    Suffer more attenuation
    Less susceptible to noise inteference
    Repeater recover the signal
    Retransmission device generate new and clean analog signal

  + Analog Signal: continuous
    Wireless
    Fiber
    Cable
    Transmit with out regard to content
    Amplifier boost signal but cause distortion

** Frequency-Domain Concept

- Fundamental frequency
  Gcd of all frequency
- Spectrum
  Range of the frequency signal
- Absolute bandwidth
  Width of the spectrum
- Effective bandwidth
  Narrow of the bandwidth that most of the signal's energy is contained in

Period of the total signal equals to the period of the fundamental frequency

** Data rate and bandwidth
