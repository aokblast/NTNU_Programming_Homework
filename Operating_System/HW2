Pros: We don't have to use different function to handle different types of the destionation we want to write

Cons: Everything must use general perpose function(Ex. If we want to control a light in some device with Linux, we have to write the file descriptor of the deviceby write()  instead of just turning it up by using a more intuitive method like turnOn())

ab. In linux, we can use many to get useful debug informatiom

	* strace: check all syscall make by the process
	* gdb: set break-point, disassamble, check the program stack where program failed
	* pmap: display a memory map of the process
