#+TITLE: Verilog Note

* CH1 - Introduction

** Transistor and Circuit Fabrication

*** Type of Semiconductor

+ P-type :: 3 valence electrons, has hole
+ N-type :: 5 valence electrons, has free electrons

*** Diode

A p-type semiconductor plus a n-type semiconductor

electron flow will flow from p to n

*** MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor)

Gate + Source + Drain

A switch for digital circuit design

Flow will flow from source to drain when on

- nMOS

1: on
0: off

- pMOS

1: off
0: on

*** Circuit fabrication step

1. silicon -> silicon ingot
2. ingot -> wafer
3. wafer -> circuit
   resin ( photoresist ) coat on wafer
   paste diagram on circuit ( by mask ) -> photo lithography ( by stepper )
4. wafer -> die -> package
   dicing to die ( diamond blade )
   silver paste paste die to island ( package )
   connect chip with wire ( bonding )
5. encapsulation
   molding resin
