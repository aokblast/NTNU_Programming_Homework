#+TITLE: Verilog Note

* CH1 - Introduction

** Transistor and Circuit Fabrication

*** Type of Semiconductor

+ P-type :: 3 valence electrons, has hole
+ N-type :: 5 valence electrons, has free electrons

*** Diode

A p-type semiconductor plus a n-type semiconductor

electron flow will flow from p to n

*** MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor)

Gate + Source + Drain

A switch for digital circuit design

Flow will flow from source to drain when on

- nMOS

1: on
0: off

- pMOS

1: off
0: on

*** Circuit fabrication step

1. silicon -> silicon ingot
2. ingot -> wafer
3. wafer -> circuit
   resin ( photoresist ) coat on wafer
   paste diagram on circuit ( by mask ) -> photo lithography ( by stepper )
4. wafer -> die -> package
   dicing to die ( diamond blade )
   silver paste paste die to island ( package )
   connect chip with wire ( bonding )
5. encapsulation
   molding resin


*** Logic Circuit

AND, OR, XOR...

*** Digital Circuit

+ Multiplexer
+ Latch
  Change when CLK is 1, unchanged when CLK is 0
+ Flip flop
  Change when CLK is up, unchanged when other case

*** Cost

+ NRE costs
  Fixed cost on design
  Influence by the design complexity and productivity

+ Recurring cost
  Silicon processing
  Assembly
  Test

*** VLSI Design Flow

1. Specification
   What chip do
   How fast
   How much power
   Size

2. Register Transfer Level Design Like workflow in MIPS (RTL)
   Set of registers
   Operation
   Control

3. Gate Level Design
   All in logic gate

4. Circuit Level Design
   To basic electronic things
   By trransistor

5. Physical Design
   To chemistry things
   Layout for fabrication
   Placement and Routing
   DRC happens in here

*** Design style

1. Full custom design
   Design from scratch

2. Standard cell
   Stop in Logic Level

3. Gate Array
   Wire and between the cell are customized

4. FPGA

*** Programmable Logic Devices  (PLDs)

PLD is a general purpose chip for implementing logic circuitry

- Advantage: ideal for low volume production, low NRE cost
- Disadvantage: lower performance and large chip size
- Can be divided based on capacity complexity and architecture
  1. Simple PLDs ( SPLDs )
  2. Complex PLDs ( CPLDs )
  3. FPGA


** HDLs

*** HDL are the major tools for the RTL level and gate ;eve; design of VLSI circuit

1. Highly portable and readable
2. Support structured design methodology
3. Support hardware concurrency
4. Serve as IP repository

*** Major HDLs

1. VHDL ( VHSIC HDL )
   Better system level
   Close to Ada/Pascal
   User define data structure

2. Verilog
   Better at agte/transisitor level
   Close to C
   Pre-defined data type, easy to use

* CH2 - VHDL

** Data Class

1. Constant
2. Variable
3. Signal
4. File
5. Ports of an entity. All ports are signal object.
6. Generics of an entity. These are constatnt objects.
7. Formal parameter of functions and procedures

** Data Type

+ Scalar Type
   Enumeration
   Integer
   Physical
   Floating

+ Composite Type
  Array
  Record

+ Access Type :: Pointer
+ File Type
