#+TITLE: Verilog Note

* CH1 - Introduction

** Transistor and Circuit Fabrication

*** Type of Semiconductor

+ P-type :: 3 valence electrons, has hole
+ N-type :: 5 valence electrons, has free electrons

*** Diode

A p-type semiconductor plus a n-type semiconductor

electron flow will flow from p to n

*** MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor)

Gate + Source + Drain

A switch for digital circuit design

Flow will flow from source to drain when on

- nMOS

1: on
0: off

- pMOS
