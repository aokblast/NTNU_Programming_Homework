## Data Structure

### Linked List

Storing Pair and Edges for graph

## Pair

The edge pair for <cost, <from, to>> to store the cost to do kruskal algorithm

## Disjoint Set

Use disjoint set with path compression to check if two vertexs are connected

## Time complexity

$O(mlog(m))$ to merge sort the edges

$O(m)$ to do kruskal and $O(1)$ to use disjoint set

So the total cost is $O(mlong(m)) + O(m) = O(mlog(m))$
